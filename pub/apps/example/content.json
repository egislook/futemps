  "text2": "Careful: the variable \"settings\" will be modified, though. jQuery doesn't return a new instance.The reason for this (and for the naming) is that .extend() was developed to extend objects, rather than to munge stuff together. If you want a new object (e.g. settings is defaults you don't want to touch), you can always jQuery.extend({}, settings, options) testing",
